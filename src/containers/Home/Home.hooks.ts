    "**Equipment Adaptor**\n=====================\n\nThe Equipment Adaptor is a crucial component of the E3 architecture, serving as the equipment integration component. It enables real-time information collection from the equipment and sends it to E3, while also sending messages from E3 back to the equipment (like R2R parameter updates).\n\n**Functions of Equipment Adaptor**\n--------------------------------\n\nThe Equipment Adaptor performs several key functions:\n\n* Provides the interface connection between the equipment and E3\n* Retrieves equipment configuration information from E3 to be used by the equipment controller\n* Instructs the equipment controller to collect data from the equipment\n* Receives events, data, and alarms from the equipment and sends them to E3\n* Maps the equipment messages to the E3 Process Type messages\n* Sends messages from E3 to the equipment controller and waits for the reply\n* Provides logging and error notification capability\n\n**Equipment Adaptor Integration Options**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe Equipment Adaptor provides flexible equipment connection options by supporting multiple types of equipment drivers, such as:\n\n* SECS/GEM\n* Interface A (EDA)\n* OPC\n* Offline saved files\n\nThis means that E3 can communicate with various types of equipment through existing drivers or custom-written drivers using APIs.\n\n**Equipment Adaptor Architecture**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe Equipment Adaptor architecture consists of the following components:\n\n* **Equipment adapter SDK**: provides the .NET XML/SOAP connection to E3 and exposes the equipment connection APIs to the Collector and custom equipment controller applications\n* **Data collector**: schedules and requests data collection from the equipment driver according to the data collection plan and provides a subset of the SDK APIs to the equipment driver\n* **Optional plug-in DLL**: optionally written Custom DLL to handle unique or special equipment scenarios\n* **Equipment driver**: written specifically for different types of equipment communications, interfaces directly with the equipment communications software layer to interact with the equipment\n\n**Equipment Adaptor Workflow**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Equipment Adaptor workflow describes the ordering of messages performed in a normal SDK to E3 setup. The following messaging diagram shows the communication between the equipment, EAP, SDK, and E3.\n\n**Querying Sensor Data Programmatically**\n--------------------------------------\n\nTo facilitate easier data query mechanisms from external applications, ClientService hosts several REST API's. These APIs provide easy access to data such as tools, sensors, runs, sensor data, events, alarm, and EC. The APIs work transparently with both Oracle and KDB databases.\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nIn summary, the Equipment Adaptor is a vital component of the E3 architecture, enabling real-time information collection from equipment and sending messages between the equipment and E3. Its flexible integration options and workflow make it an essential tool for seamless communication between different types of equipment and E3.",
